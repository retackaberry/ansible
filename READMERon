This is a new ansible repo that is synced on git. There's a dir under ~/dev called oldansible that contains
all the old good ansible files. Plan is to move them into this synced directory one at a time as 
they're tested.

Some simple ansible commands:
ansible all -m ping -- gives a pong response
ansible all -m setup -- gives info about the remote machines

Files:
  install_sudoers.yml -- Make retackaberry a sudoer that doesn't need password. This account will then run all 
                         other ansible accounts without password.

  hello.yml -- Simple playbook to write a textfile into /tmp on the server. Mostly used to sanity check everything
